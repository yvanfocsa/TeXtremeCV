## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed on your machine.

### Installation

To install LaTeX for working with a LaTeX project like TeXtremeCV, you need to follow different steps depending on your operating system.

Here's a guide for Windows, Linux, and macOS:

### For Windows:

1. **Install MiKTeX**: 
   - Visit the [MiKTeX website](https://miktex.org/) and download the installer for Windows.
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions to install MiKTeX on your system.

2. **Install a LaTeX Editor (Optional)**: 
   - You can use any text editor to write LaTeX documents, but using a dedicated LaTeX editor can be more convenient. 
   - A popular choice is [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/). Download and install it from the website.

### For Linux:

1. **Install TeX Live**:
   - Most Linux distributions have TeX Live in their repositories. 
   - You can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can use: `sudo apt-get install texlive-full`

2. **Install a LaTeX Editor (Optional)**:
   - Linux has several LaTeX editors like TeXstudio, TeXmaker, or Kile. 
   - You can install them from your package manager. For example, `sudo apt-get install texstudio` for TeXstudio.

### For macOS:

1. **Install MacTeX**:
   - Visit the [MacTeX website](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) and download the MacTeX distribution.
   - Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the instructions to install MacTeX.

2. **Install a LaTeX Editor (Optional)**:
   - TeXShop is a popular LaTeX editor for macOS, and it comes bundled with MacTeX.
   - If you prefer another editor, you can install it separately. TeXstudio, for example, is also available for macOS.

### Post-Installation Steps:

- After installing LaTeX, you can clone the TeXtremeCV repository and use the LaTeX distribution to compile `.tex` files.
- If you're using a LaTeX editor, you can open the `.tex` files with the editor and compile them directly from there.

Remember that LaTeX can be quite extensive, and the full installation (like `texlive-full` on Linux) may take a significant amount of disk space. If you are constrained by disk space, you can opt for a more basic installation and install additional packages as needed.

### Customizing and Using the TeXtremeCV Template

The TeXtremeCV template provides a robust framework for creating a professional CV in LaTeX. Here’s a summary of how to customize and use this template for your own CV:

  Personal Information:
  
      Update your name, job title, contact details, and optional photo.
      This forms the header of your CV, setting the tone for your professional persona.

  Introduction:
  
      Craft a concise introduction, summarizing your professional background and objectives.

  Skills and Languages:
  
      Highlight key skills and language proficiencies relevant to your career.

  Professional Experience:
  
      Detail your most significant roles and achievements using \cventry.

  Education:
  
      List your educational qualifications in a clear, chronological order.

  Customizing GitHub and LinkedIn Links:
  
      At the bottom, links to your GitHub and LinkedIn profiles are included.
      Replace the URLs in the \href{} tags with your own profile links.
      For example, change https://github.com/yvanfocsa to your GitHub profile URL.
      Similarly, update the LinkedIn URL to point to your LinkedIn profile.
      These links are essential for providing a direct path to your professional online presence.
